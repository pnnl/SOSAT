class StressState:
    """
    A class to contain all data necessary to define the probability
    distribution for all possible stress states at a given point in the
    subsurface.

    Attributes
    ----------
    depth : float
        The true vertical depth of the point being analyzed
    vertical_stress : float
        The total vertical stress, currently taken as deterministic
    pore_pressure : float
        The pore pressure, currently taken as deterministic
    shmin_grid : numpy MaskedArray object
        A 2D array containing the value of the minimum horizontal
        stress for each stress state considered. Values that are not
        admissible, such as where the minimum horizontal stress would
        be greater than the maximum horizontal stress are masked
    shmax_grid : numpy MaskedArray object
        A 2D array containing the value of the mmaximum horizontal
        stress for each stress state considered. Values that are not
        admissible, such as where the minimum horizontal stress would
        be greater than the maximum horizontal stress are masked
    stress_unit : str
        The unit used for stress
    depth_unit : str
        The unit used for vertical depth

    Parameters
    ----------
    depth : float
        the true vertical depth of the point being analyzed
    average_overburden_density : float
         average mass density of all overlying formations
    pore_pressure : float
        formation pore pressure
    depth_unit : str, optional
        unit of measurement for depth, see list of units in pint
        package documentation
    density_unit : str, optional
        unit of measurement for mass density, see list of units in
        pintpackage documentation
    pressure_unit : str, optional
        unit of measurement for pressure, see list of units in pint
        package documentation
    min_stress_ratio : float, optional
        Minimum stress included in the analysis expressed as a fraction
        of the vertical stress. This is not intended as a way to express
        a prior probability but is instead meant as a convenient way to
        set the bounds of stress considered in the analysis. It does
        effectively truncate the stress distribution at this value and
        so should be chose well outside of the zone of significant
        probability density. Default value is 0.4
    max_stress_ratio : float
        Maximum stress included in the analysis expressed as a fraction
        of the vertical stress. This is not intended as a way to express
        a prior probability but is instead meant as a convenient way to
        set the bounds of stress considered in the analysis. It does
        effectively truncate the stress distribution at this value and
        so should be chose well outside of the zone of significant
        probability density. Default value is 3.25
    nbins : int
        number of bins to use for the horizontal principal stresses.
        The same number is used for both horizontal principal stresses.
        Default value is 200.

    Notes
    -----
    This class applies the Bayesian approach to quantifying uncertainty
    in the state of stress at a single point in the subsurface that is
    outlined in [1]_. By "single point" here we mean any volume of the
    subsurface that the user wishes to treat as having a homogeneous
    stress state the. Depending on the application this could be a
    volume with length scale of a log scale (tens of centimeters) or
    in a regional-scale analysis could be a volume with length scale of
    kilometers.

    Currently the vertical stress and pore pressure are taken as
    deterministically known, so that uncertainties in these values
    are not reflected in the uncertainty in the the horizontal
    principal stresses. This may change in a future release, but in
    many applications is not a big limitation because there is
    generally a smaller uncertainty in the vertical stress and pore
    pressure compared to the horizontal principal stresses.

    Currently this class does not contain stress orientation
    information, though this too is planned to change in a future
    release. Though this would only add significant value when methods
    to add different StressState objects are needed and implemented.
    This will be required, for example, to interpolate between
    different points where a StressState object has been parameterized.

    To compute and plot the posterior distribution at a point
    with a frictional faulting constraint, you would do the following:

    >>> ss = StressState(1.0,
                         2.5,
